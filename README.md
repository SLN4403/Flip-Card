# Flip-Card 💳✨

<h3> Description 📝 </h3>
This is a practice project I saw on youtube which is written with HTML & CSS. I give 100% credit to the original creator. It has two sides, which are front and back. When you hover a mouse onto the front card, it will immediately flip to the back side. Cool, right xD ? I also added a link down below so that you could try in on ur own.
