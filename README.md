# Flip-Card 💳✨

<h3> Description 📝 </h3>
This is a practice project I saw on youtube which is writtem with HTML & CSS. I give 100% creadit to the original creator.
It has two sides which are front and back. When u hover a mouse on a front card, it will immediately flip to the back side. Cool right ?
